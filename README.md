# ChargeMonitor

Background: 
I tend to overcharge my phone which was impacting the overall battery health of the device. Play store alternatives had too much ads, some were paid and were collecting too much data. 
So I decided to build this app that would monitor the battery charge level when the device is plugged in to the charger. And when the device is charged above the desired charge level it will let the user know via - push notifications/ playing a sound/ device vibration etc. 

When the app is launched - user can enable the battery charge monitoring and define a desired charge level. 
User can also configure how to get notified - via push notifications, playing a sound, vibrations, themes etc from the settings menu.
